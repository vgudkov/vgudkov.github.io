		<p>It all began in 2013: the Belgian printing company Halewijn NV invested in new technology for the production of the church newspa- per KERK&leven (Church and Life).

The production line, with its dyna- mic processing principle, makes it possible to produce print products whose contents and size change from one copy to the next. Hale- wijn also wanted to make this uni- que advantage of digital printing and finishing technology available to external interest groups. Gens-
